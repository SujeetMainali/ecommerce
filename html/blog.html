                    How <b>TECHNOLOGY</b> has Affected our daily life
                </h2>
                <!-- introduction of the blog -->
                <p>
                    The society we live in today is based on technology that people have developed over thousands of
                    years. The <b>rapid advancement</b> of technology has rendered life practically different from what
                    it was even a century ago. We are <b>totally dependent</b> on the technology we have. This reliance
                    isn't just about your inability to put down your <b>phone</b> for more than a few moments; it's
                    about the many technologies that probably take for granted that may have <b>saved</b> ones life or
                    enabled ones current life without even realizing it. <br>
                    Technology will only <b>improve</b>, and because new technology is so <b>productive</b>, it will
                    only
                    evolve at an even <b>faster pace</b>. Throughout history, the human species has leaned on technology
                    for survival, so resting or slowing down is just not an option. Technology must evolve, and it will
                    continue to evolve at an ever-increasing rate to meet today's challenges. Some of the <b>gifts</b>
                    of the technology are as follows:
                </p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Positive affects of Technology</h3>
                <p>
                    Evertyhing has both positive and negative parts. As technology helps us to do our works in easy way
                    in very less time it is the best part of the technology. some of the positive aspects of the
                    technology are:
                </p>
                <div class="lists">

                        </li>
                        <p>
                            Technology is really helping to connect the World. Social medias are the best gift of
                            technology.

                            The term "social media" refers to the means by which people interact in virtual
                            communities and networks by <b>creating, sharing, and exchanging</b> information and
                            ideas.It has helped us to share our feelings, communicate with other people far from us.
                            Previously it was very difficult to communicate to the people far from us. Also it was very
                            costly. But now after the <b>Internet</b> and gadgets, we can have realtime talks face to
                            face in very cheap cost.

                        <p>
                            Technology has really helped in education sector. It as gives access to free education to
                            million of students. We can get <b>knowledge</b> on any topic on <a
                                href="https://www.google.com"><i><b>Google</b></i></a> and <a
                                href="https://www.youtube.com"><i><b>Youtube </b></i></a>. To conduct research before
                            the Internet, you would have to visit a library. Even so, there's a chance the library
                            didn't have the books you required.
                            <img src="../images/techIneducation.jpg" alt="" width="200px">
                            Then you'd have to go to the library and request the books, which could take some time.
                            Research was time-consuming and inconvenient. You may get information on any topic you can
                            think of using the Internet. <br>
                            You'll have no issue locating various sources to double-check the accuracy of the
                            information you get.Many people who would like to further their education are unable to do
                            so because they are employed, caring for families, or live too far away from their local
                            institution to travel. All of that has altered thanks to online programs. Students can now
                            enroll in online programs or take single classes at their leisure, without having to leave
                            their homes. Also at the time of <b>COVID-19</b> technology have contributed a lot in
                            education sector. Due to technology only the education of millions of students was not
                            hampered.

                            We live in a capitalist society, which means that many new technological advancements are
                            driven by businesses wanting to improve their products/services or their capacity to market
                            those products/services.

                            Over time, new technology has arisen with the goal of making corporate processes more
                            efficient and successful. <br><b>Transactions</b> are far simpler and more efficient now
                            than they were previously. On the consumer side, innovations such as the credit card and the
                            rise of <b>e-commerce</b> have made it easier than ever for companies to sell items and
                            services to customers when and when they want them. <br> On a Business - to - business
                            level, however, transactions are significantly easier on a large scale. Companies buying
                            components for their goods, for example, would frequently have to wait days for funds to
                            clear, especially if the component's manufacturer was located overseas.

                <p>
                    Along with lots of positive sides, technology have a lot of negative affects too. Due to technology
                    world has been progressive for progressive ones and cruel for the ones who cannot take the
                    advantages of the technology in the right way. Some of the Negative affects of the technology are:

                            Although social media and other technologies are supposed to bring people together, but they
                            may have the opposite impact in some circumstances.
                            <img src="../images/mental problem.jpg" width="200px" alt="">
                            According to a <b>2017 research</b> of young adults aged 19-32, individuals who used social
                            media more frequently were more than three times as likely to feel socially <b>isolated</b>
                            as those who did not. <br>

                            Finding strategies to limit social media use, such as putting time <b>limitations</b> on
                            social apps, may help some people feel less isolated. Also the people with high time in
                            social medias are likely to suffer from <b>depression</b> and <b>anxiety</b>. They would
                            compare themselves to high profile and act themselves like others.
                            <br> Similarly, in the recent times various games have affected the <b>mental health</b> of
                            the childrens. People of young age have started to invest more time on social medias and
                            games rather than building themselves to be the good citizen and the person. In this rate,
                            there will be severe problem of unemployment and other social problems.

                            Excessive use of technology also causes various physical problems to a person. Using social
                            medias and other <b>screen time</b> gadgets causes various eye problems.
                            <img src="../images/eyeache.jpg" alt="" width="200px">
                            Handheld tablets, cellphones, and computers, for example, can hold a person's attention for
                            long periods of time. This may lead to eyestrain. <br>
                            <b>Blurred</b> vision and dry eyes are two common symptoms of digital eyestrain. Eye strain
                            can cause pain in other parts of the body, including the head, neck, and shoulders. <br> Not
                            only Problems in eyes, due to light emitting gadgets we may have sleep problems too. Using
                            technology too close to <b>bedtime</b> can lead to sleep problems. Blue light, such as that
                            from cell phones, e-readers, and laptops, stimulates the brain, which causes this effect.

                                style="float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 3px; margin-bottom: 3px;">
                            According to a research study, this blue light is enough to disrupt the body's natural
                            circadian cycle. This disruption may make it difficult to fall <b>asleep</b> or cause a
                            person to be less attentive the next day. <br>
                            People should avoid using electronic gadgets that emit blue light an hour or two before
                            night to avoid the potential effects of blue light on the brain.

                            Reading a <b>book, doing easy stretches, or taking a bath</b> are examples of moderate
                            activities to relax with instead. <br>Apart from eye problems and sleepliness, excessive use
                            of technology also causes various physical problems. As we go on using more technologies we
                            forget to maintain body <b>posture</b> while adjsuting our body to be comfortable to sit.

                            This causes various body problems and bodyache. Also while using technology for every small
                            tasks, we become physically incative, which makes us physically <b>weak</b> and also varous
                            health problems like <b>diabetes</b>, <b>obesity</b>, <b>cardiovascular diseases</b> and
                            <b>premature death</b> is caused.

                            The industrial revolution brought along plenty of new technologies with immense potential.
                            Between around 1760 and 1840, Europe and the United States experienced a transition to new
                            manufacturing processes. This has been followed by continued <b>industrialization</b> and

                            Various social problems are caused by trchnology. One of the common social problem caused by
                            technology is <b>hacking</b> and

                            data breaching. As technologies like social medias and gaming are causing mental health
                            problems in the people, social crimes are also being increased day by day. Youths are being

                            to wrong path. <b>Defamation</b>, <b>Identity Theft</b> and <b>Cyber bullying</b> are other
                            social problems caused by technology. <br>The internet and computers have also made it
                            simpler for bitter people to

                            target those they know directly as well as complete <b>strangers</b> via online platforms.
                            This has resulted in significant cyberbullying
                            instances involving both children and adults, with terrible consequences in some cases. The
                            issue with these methods is that they tend to fly under the radar even more than typical
                            bullying, making them more difficult to detect and address.

                <p>
                    Lastly, we can conclude that technology is beneficial when able to use in right way but very harmful
                    when not being able to handle. It is like a cartoon of Glass which should be handled properly. If we
                    handle the box of glass properly, then we can enjoy our drinks and if we are unable to handle that
                    box then we end up hurting ourselves. For the better use of technology we should encourage youths to
                    get involved in social activities rather than getting engaged in social medias all the times. Sport
                    activities should be promoted for physical and mental health of the people. Youths should be
                    encouraged to make less friends from society rather hundreds of e-Friends.
